# Predicting-Online-Purchase-Intention

E-commerce has transformed the retail landscape
by providing unparalleled convenience and accessibility. However, low conversion rates remain a persistent challenge, driven
by complex customer behaviors that are difficult to interpret
in digital environments. 

Predicting online shoppersâ€™ purchase intentions is critical for addressing these challenges and improving conversion rates. This study focuses on the widely used
dataset introduced by Sakar et al., which reflects the imbalanced
nature of purchase intention data. To address this imbalance,
we employed the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE) to enhance model training. Various machine learning
models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Stacking,
and XGBoost, were compared using metrics such as F1-Score,
Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), auROC, and auPR.
Our results demonstrate that XGBoost outperforms other
models, achieving an F1-Score of 0.8956, MCC of 0.5988,
and auROC of 0.9283. The combination of feature selection
and SMOTE significantly improved classification performance,
underscoring the critical role of preprocessing in e-commerce
prediction tasks. By leveraging ensemble methods and advanced
evaluation metrics, this study highlights the potential of machine
learning in building robust predictive models to analyze customer
behavior and improve e-commerce platform performance.
